# Blueprints

## Customizing Blueprints

You may add fields to your product blueprints or rearrange existing ones to customize your experience. You only need to make sure not to delete any pre-existing fields to ensure the addon's functionality.

## Assets Container

The asset container for the product images defaults to `assets`. You may change this to any container you want.

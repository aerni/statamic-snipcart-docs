# Snipcart Webhooks

## Configuration

[Define the route](https://snipcart.docs.michaelaerni.ch/setup/configuration#snipcart-webhook-route) of your Snipcart Webhook and [add the absolute URL in your Snipcart Dashboard](https://app.snipcart.com/dashboard/webhooks).

## Basic Usage

The underlying package listens to incoming Webhook requests and dispatches Laravel Events accordingly. Create Laravel Event Listeners or Subscribers and do your custom magic.

[Read the documentation of Snipcart Webhooks](https://github.com/aerni/snipcart-webhooks).
